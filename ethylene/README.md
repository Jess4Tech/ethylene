# Ethylene - A safe, runtime-independent asynchronous ORM and Query Builder for Rust

At least, that's the plan.

I'll be working on this, but results may yet be far out.

## Note
This is fairly heavily inspired by [Diesel](https://crates.io/crates/diesel). [Sea-orm](https://crates.io/crates/sea-orm) was asynchronous, but I didn't like its api as much.
This is intended to be like Diesel, but based on [sqlx](https://crates.io/crates/sqlx).
If either of those two crates fit your bill, you're more likely to get good results out of them, for now.
